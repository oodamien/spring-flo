## Introduction

**Spring Flo** is a JavaScript library that offers a basic embeddable HTML5 visual builder for pipelines and simple graphs. 
This library is used as the basis of the stream builder in **Spring Cloud Data Flow**.

Here is a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78CgV46OstI) of **Spring Flo** in action.

## How To Use

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-flo/wiki) for more information on how to embed it in an application.

Please ensure that at a minimum [Node.js][], [npm][] and the [Angular CLI][] are available on your system. In order to execute the build simply do:

	$ git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-flo.git
	$ npm install
	$ npm run build
	
Build results are produced under the __dist__ folder.

A small self contained sample usage of **Spring Flo** is available in the [demo](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-flo/tree/master/src/demo) sub folder. Execute `npm start` to run the sample. 
The [Spring Cloud Data Flow UI](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-ui) at github shows a larger scale usage of **Spring Flo**.

**Spring Flo** is Open Source software released under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
